## FabricOps - The Microsoft Fabric DevOps Automation Platform

A comprehensive Microsoft Fabric automation platform demonstrating enterprise-grade DevOps practices, infrastructure as code (IaC), CI/CD workflows, and modern ways-of-working for data platform delivery.

## Overview

FabricOps is a production-ready automation framework designed to showcase best practices for Microsoft Fabric workspace management, solution delivery, and collaborative development workflows. This platform serves as both a demonstration tool for community conferences and events, and a boilerplate reference for enterprise Fabric implementations.

The solution represents a realistic enterprise scenario with:
- **Multi-environment architecture** (dev, test, prod)
- **Automated infrastructure provisioning and teardown**
- **Feature-based development workflows**
- **Comprehensive CI/CD pipelines**
- **Quality gates and validation processes**

It includes fully automated pipelines that support modern ways of working, validation, and deployment across environments while maintaining workspace synchronization and orchestrating complex cross-workspace deployments.

## Getting Started

### Initial Setup

1. **Create your repository**
   ```bash
   # Create new Azure DevOps project or GitHub repository
   # Clone this repository as a template
   git clone https://github.com/gronnerup/FabricOps.git
   cd FabricOps
   ```

2. **Configure authentication**
   ```bash
   # Copy credential template and configure
   cp automation/credentials/credentials_template.json automation/credentials/credentials.json
   # Update with your Service Principal details
   ```

3. **Update environment configurations**
   - Modify `automation/resources/environments/infrastructure.json`
   - Configure environment-specific files (`infrastructure.dev.json`, etc.)
   - Update Git provider settings in environment files

4. **Run platform setup**
   ```bash
   # For Azure DevOps
   python automation/scripts/locale/locale_setup_azuredevops.py
   
   # For GitHub
   python automation/scripts/locale/locale_setup_github.py
   ```

5. **Deploy infrastructure**
   - Commit changes and create pull request
